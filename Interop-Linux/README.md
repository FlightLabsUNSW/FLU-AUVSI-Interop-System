# AUVSI SUAS 2020 FLU Interop Interface
Following the successful implementation of the 2019 System at the AUVSI SUAS competition, a new revision of the same system has been developed to optimise the uploading of objects, while also making implementation with the computer vision and Linux ground station considerably easier for the 2020 competition. Once complete, ideally, only one script will be required to be run, which will start the interop interface, interop server (if required for testing) and telemetry upload to the server. As of December 2019, these scripts are still in development.

## Setup & installation requirements
Description

## User input requirements
To easily collate user-generated information and not require constant re-inputting of data on every upload, the "mission-params.json" file is used. In this file, the following parameters can be configured:
- ID: Used for debugging only
- IP: Raw IP address of the interop server (i.e. 192.168.1.16)
- Mission ID: Mission ID given to the team (if unsure before comp, use 1)
- Port: Raw port of the interop server (i.e. 8000)
- Username & Password: Login details for the interop server
- Device IP: Full IP address (including port) for telemetry output from MAVProxy (i.e. 192.168.1.16:14550)
- Comport: Serial USB port where telemetry is going into the computer system (i.e. /dev/ttyUSB0)

These parameters must be updated prior to starting the system, and **MUST** be set by the user and are not automatically generated by the FLU interop system.
