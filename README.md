# FLU AUVSI Interop System Interfaces (2019-2020)

The Flight Labs UNSW Interoperability System Interface has been developed alongside the provided docker images from the AUVSI SUAS competition organisers, allowing for interaction with the judging server in an easy-to-use way. Currently, there exist two interfaces that can be used, a Windows-Linux hybrid system requiring considerable setup, and a full-Linux setup requiring much less setup. It is therefore recommended that, where possible, the full-Linux implementation is used where possible.  

## Linux-Based Interop System

All information regarding the full-Linux implementation of the FLU Interop System has been documented in the README.md file under the 'Interop-Linux' folder. For any questions, queries, or additional functionality that could be useful for the system to include, talk to Marco (malberto23).  

**NOTE:** This code is still in development, however is fully functional and could be used in its current state. Code commenting is still in progress, and several sections of the README.md file are still missing.  

## Windows-Hybrid Interop System

For all information regarding the Windows-Linux-hybrid system, navigate to the wiki, which provides a detailed description of using and setting up the software required to use the files in the 'Interop-Windows' folder. This wiki can also be found at the link below:

**NOTE:** The wiki has not been updated to reflect the most recent changes for the 2019 version, however contains most of the required information. The reason for this lack of update is predominately due to the fact that it is no longer in use, is quite inefficient and clunky, and honestly don't know why I did it like that in the first place... Shell scripting rules the world!
