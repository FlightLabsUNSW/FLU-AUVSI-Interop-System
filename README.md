# FLU AUVSI Interop System
This folder includes all of the scripts and file/folder requirements for the current and past versions of the Flight Labs UNSW Interoperability System Interface.

For the 2020 system, the setup and detailed information will likely be in the README.md file in the 2020 system folder (to be confirmed). Talk to Marco (malberto23) for any questions regarding this before 1 Feb 2020.

For the 2019 system, please navigate to the wiki for a detailed explanation of setting up, and using the above files:
https://github.com/FlightLabsUNSW/FLU-AUVSI-Interop-System/wiki
Please note: Wiki has not been updated to reflect the most recent changes for the 2019 version, predominately due to the fact that it is no longer in use and is quite inefficient and clunky.
